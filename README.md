# DrawApp

My first test of a neural network trained with tensorflow, here included in a basic android application exploiting tensorflow lite.
The network topology is a CNN trained on the usual MNIST handwritten digit database. 
While the NN was able to achieve a good accuracy, the mismach with the data input on the phone makes the end result not optimal.
